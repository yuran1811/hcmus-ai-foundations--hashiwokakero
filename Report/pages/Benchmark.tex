\subsection{Tests and Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Test cases description}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Each map size in (7 × 7), (9 × 9), (11 × 11), (13 × 13), (17 × 17), (20 × 20) has at least 5 test cases with different difficulty levels.
              \item The test cases are generated randomly and the difficulty levels are classified as easy, medium, hard, and very hard. The results of the tests are shown in the table below. The time is measured in milliseconds (ms) and the peak memory is measured in kilobytes (KB).
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Experiment results}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Solving Time (ms)
              \item Peak Memory (KB)
          \end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Challenges in the implementation}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item The algorithm is not optimal for large maps, which leads to a long solving time and high peak memory usage.
              \item The algorithm is not able to solve some test cases with a very high difficulty level.
