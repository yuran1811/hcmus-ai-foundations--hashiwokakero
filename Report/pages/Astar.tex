\subsection{A* Search with heuristic}
\noindent The A* algorithm is a widely used technique for pathfinding and graph traversal. It relies heavily on heuristics to estimate the future cost of reaching the goal. Essentially, A* extends uniform cost search by incorporating a heuristic function to guide its path selection, making it more efficient in many cases. The choice of heuristic depends on the specific problem domain, highlighting the importance of domain knowledge. For A* to be consistent, the modified cost function must always remain greater than zero.

\subsubsection{Pseudocode}
\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{A* Search (\textit{start, goal, heuristic})}
	\label{alg:astar}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\State priority queue \(\gets\) [(start, cost = 0, estimated total cost = heuristic(start))]
		\While {priority queue is not empty}
		\State (node, cost) \(\gets\) dequeue(priority queue)
		\If {node = goal}
		\State return path
		\EndIf
		\ForAll {neighbor in valid moves}
		\State new cost \(\gets\) cost + move cost
		\State estimated total cost \(\gets\) new cost + heuristic(neighbor)
		\If {neighbor not visited or new cost \(<\) previous cost}
		\State mark neighbor as visited
		\State enqueue(priority queue, (neighbor, new cost, estimated total cost))
		\EndIf
		\EndFor
		\EndWhile
		\State return failure
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Heuristics in A* Algorithm}
A* search uses a heuristic function \( h(n) \) to estimate the cost from a given state to the goal. The total cost function is defined as:
\[
	f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \( g(n) \) is the actual cost from the start state to the current state \( n \).
	\item \( h(n) \) is the estimated cost from \( n \) to the goal state.
\end{itemize}
For Sokoban, common heuristic choices include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Manhattan Distance:} The sum of the absolute differences between the x and y coordinates of each stone and its nearest goal position.
	\item \textbf{Hungarian Algorithm:} Computes an optimal assignment of stones to switches, minimizing the total weighted Manhattan distance.
\end{itemize}
A* is optimal if \( h(n) \) is \textit{admissible} (never overestimates the true cost) and \textit{consistent} (satisfies the triangle inequality).

\subsubsection{Time and Space Complexity}
\textbf{Time Complexity:} \( O(b^d) \) in the worst case, but with a good heuristic, it can be significantly reduced. If the heuristic is admissible and consistent, A* is optimal and complete.

\textbf{Space Complexity:} \( O(b^d) \), as it keeps all generated nodes in memory.
